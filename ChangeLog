11/11/2004 - Release 1.0
12/05/2004 - Release 1.01
  a) created 'usage()' function
  b) added '-m' switch (opposite of '-u')
  c) changed default for *nix systems to '-u', and MS-DOS/Windows
     to '-m' (for either CTRL+M or Microsoft, your choice)
  d) added 'getarg' support for *NIX systems
  e) added a 'getarg' equivalent for other systems that don't support
     a 'getarg' function.
  f) added wildcard and multiple file name support on the command
     line, for more consistency with *nix command line utilities.
  g) added '-r' to recurse sub-directories
  h) added '-n' and '-b' to control backup / no backup ('-b' remains
     the default)
  i) Defined 'recursion' so that a file name specification passed in
     quotes (i.e. not globbed) will recurse all directories with the
     specified pattern, not just directories matching the pattern.
     The behavior with 'globbed' files matches that of other utilities,
     with a default specification of '*.*' added to any directory that
     is passed on the command line.
