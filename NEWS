Version 1.0
  Initial release 11/11/2004
Version 1.01
  Major update to original, primarily to introduce the new
  functionality and to make the application 100% compatible
  with the *nix shells.  Recursion is now supported, using
  wildcard specs for directory names, specified directly or
  as 'globbed' arguments from the shell.  Quoted wildcard
  file names (not globbed) search all sub-directories when
  recursing, and apply the pattern to each sub-directory.

  Therefore, to run 'crlf' on all '.txt' files, you would
  use a command similar to the following:
    crlf -r "*.txt"
  This would recurse all directories, looking for files that
  match the pattern "*.txt", and operate on them.  If the
  quotes were not present, files matching "*.txt" would be
  'globbed' by the shell, and any sub-directories found would
  be searched with a file name specification of "*.*".  Since
  it is unlikely you would have a directory name that matches
  the pattern "*.txt" the 'globbed' option is meaningless, and
  of very limited use.  The behavior of crlf is superior to
  the 'globbing effect' caused by the shells.
